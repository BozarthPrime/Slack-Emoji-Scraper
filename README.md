# Slack-Emoji-Scraper
Pulls emoji information from a slack instance

## Usage
Get Emoji Stats directly from your browser's developer tools with this script. Here's how:

- Open up https://yourdomain.slack.com/customize/emoji in a browser window
- Open up the developer console in your browser (genrally F12 but you can also use the menu)

### Pick the correct route for the browser you are using
#### For Firefox
- Click the "console" tab on the top of the tools bar
- Paste in the code (you may need to type an allow message for Firefox to allow this, it will let you know)
- Run the script by clicking on the run button in the top left corner of the dev tools window

#### For Chrome
- Go to the Sources Tab and the "Snippets" sub-tab (You may need to click the 3 dots next to Page or Filesystem to reveal)
- Create New Snippet and paste this code into there (Optional: Right click on the snippet name and rename it to something cool!)
- Run by right clicking on the Snippet name and selecting "Run"

### Save the output
- This will output all the emoji to the console
- Save output, formatting in bbedit or excel required
